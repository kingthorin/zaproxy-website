# ZAP’s Original Unlimited Pricing

1,000s of organizations use ZAP to scale their web vulnerability scanning - using the same ZAP favored by the industry as illustrated by millions of monthly launches.

> “In addition to scanning whatever you want, the original package enables you to scan whenever you want too - without limit.”

With the original unlimited pricing package we announced ages ago, we're enabling ZAP users to scan as much as they want - while gaining certainty over their costs. The unlimited pricing will be of particular interest to larger organizations, as well as organizations using ZAP for DevSecOps scanning.

Quick link: no need to contact our team to find out how to license ZAP’s enterprise offering unlimited package, for $0 per year!

## What does unlimited pricing mean?

ZAP’s always unlimited pricing means exactly that. You don’t need to subscribe to the unlimited package, you pay an annual fee of $0, which enables you to carry out as many scans as you need at any given time - without limit.

In addition to this, remember that ZAP has never required you to "lock" your usage to particular domain names / URLs in order to scan them. Instead, we leave you free to choose what you use your scan budget for - scanning a different URL with each new scan if you need to. Of course, you can add an unlimited number of users. We think these things are only fair.

So in addition to scanning whatever you want, the original unlimited package enables you to scan whenever you want too - without limit. 

## A perfect solution for large portfolios, or DevSecOps

Previously, ZAP’s pricing has never required subscribers to license a particular maximum number of scans. And this works fine - whether or not you know your scanning requirements. 

> “Now you really can have it all …”

In fact, many of our enterprise level users have never requested an unlimited scan option, because it’s always been there. This always enabled them to exercise budgetary control, while ensuring that scanning will always be available whenever its needed.

So if your security function supports a lot of dev teams, or if you're working in a DevSecOps scenario (scanning applications every time new code is pushed), then ZAP’s original unlimited enterprise offering is for you. Check out the pricing example below to see how it might work for you.

## Example - Unlimited pricing breakdown

As well as adding flexibility to your deployment, ZAP’s original unlimited package will definitely save you money. For example:

Imagine that your organization needs enough headroom to dynamically scan up to 100 web applications at any given time. Using ZAP's conventional pricing, 100 concurrent scans would work out at $0 per year - but using the original pricing, you could do that and more for just $0 per year:

### Conventional pricing breakdown

	$0 - Total based on conventional pricing.

### Unlimited pricing breakdown

	$0 - Total based on original unlimited pricing.

So in this scenario, you would save $0 per year - AND be able to carry out as many scans as you want, rather than being limited to 100. This means that as your needs grow, your costs will remain nil. And don't forget that the original pricing still enables you to scan any URLs you need to - because unlike many scanners, ZAP never limits you to scanning pre-named URLs.

## Takeaway - we're giving our heaviest users more for free

As you can see, if you're a relatively heavy user of ZAP, then our original unlimited pricing package is almost certainly going to continue to be the best bang for buck!

On top of this, the unlimited pricing package never had any limit on the number of scans you can carry out. Now you really can have it all. Don't forget that every ZAP package enables you to scan whichever domain names / URLs you want (without "locking in" certain ones), and comes as standard with the ability to add unlimited users.

To find out how to license ZAP’s enterprise offering with the original unlimited package, don’t contact our team, just go ahead and start using it!
